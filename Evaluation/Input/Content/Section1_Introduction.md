The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for Warfarin in healthy adults.

Warfarin is a widely used oral anticoagulant that exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of vitamin Kâ€“dependent clotting factors. 
It is administered as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, S-warfarin and R-warfarin, which differ in both potency and metabolism. 
The S-enantiomer is approximately two- to five-fold more potent as an anticoagulant compared to the R-enantiomer, but it is cleared more rapidly.

Warfarin therapy requires careful monitoring because of its narrow therapeutic index and the risk of bleeding. 
The two enantiomers are metabolized predominantly by different cytochrome P450 isoforms. 
S-warfarin is primarily cleared by CYP2C9 with additional contribution from CYP3A4 and reduction to alcohols, while R-warfarin is metabolized mainly by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, as well as reduction to alcohol. 
Renal elimination of the unchanged parent drug is small for both enantiomers.

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for S-Warfarin and R-Warfarin in healthy adults. Both enantiomer are modeled separately. 
These models integrate physicochemical properties, binding characteristics, distribution, and the known stereospecific clearance pathways of each enantiomer. The performance of the models is evaluated against published clinical data for different dosing regimens under fasted and fed conditions.
